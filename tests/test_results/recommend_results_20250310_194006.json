Ensure that the output matches the exact structure and format of the \"Desired Outputs.\"\n3. Use dynamic variable substitution for `{input_data}` only where necessary to match the desired output structure.\n4. Process each row independently without merging or inferring any data.\n5. The final output should exactly match the \"Desired Outputs,\" including syntax, spacing, and characters.\n</instructions>\n\n<steps>\n1. Extracted Name and Age components from each input row should be structured as follows: `{Name}: {Age}`\n2. For example, if an input row is \"{input_data}\", extract \"Faiz\" as the name and \"21\" as the age to output \"{Name}: Faiz, Age: 21\"\n3. Ensure that each output has a consistent format, with spaces, commas, and syntax matching the \"Desired Outputs.\"\n4. Do not add any commentary or explanations.\n5. Use the placeholder `{input_data}` for dynamic variable substitution only where necessary to match the desired output structure.\n</steps>\n\n<example>\n<inputs>0                          My name is Faiz and I am 21\n1         Hello my name is John and I am of the age 29\n2                  Hey!
