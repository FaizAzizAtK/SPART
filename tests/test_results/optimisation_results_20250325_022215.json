Here it is:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_names_and_ages(data):\n    # Regular expression to match the pattern 'name' followed by age\n    pattern = r'my name is (\\w+) and i am (\\d+)'\n    \n    # Search for the first occurrence of the pattern in the data\n    match = re.search(pattern, data)\n    \n    if match:\n        # Extract the name and age from the match object\n        name = match.group(1)\n        age = int(match.group(2))\n        \n        # Return the extracted name and age as a string\n        return f\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\"\n    else:\n        return \"No valid input found.\"\n\n# Input data example\ninput_data = \"My name is Emily and I am 19\"\n\n# Extract names and ages from the input data\nresult = extract_names_and_ages(input_data)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nWhen you run this script with your sample input, it should output:\n```\nName: Emily, Age: 19\n```",
            "However, I don't see any input data. It looks like there's a placeholder for `{input_data}`, but it's not filled with any information.\n\nIf you provide the actual input data, I'll be happy to extract the names and ages in the desired format!",
