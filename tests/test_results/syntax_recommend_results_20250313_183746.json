Colleen Siegel JERUSALEM 1996-08-22 Israel's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup. Itamar Rabinovich, who as Israel's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria, told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight. It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate. The Syrians are confused, they are definitely tense, but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup, he said. Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador. He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician. Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message, via Washington, saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions. But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere. Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test-fired a missile. It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes.\n    </input_data>\n    <desired_output>\n        <headline>Israel Downplays War Fears with Syria</headline>\n        <date>1996-08-22</date>\n        <location>Jerusalem</location>\n        <key_figures>\n            <figure>\n                <name>Itamar Rabinovich</name>\n                <role>Outgoing Peace Negotiator</role>\n            </figure>\n            <figure>\n                <name>David Levy</name>\n                <role>Israeli Foreign Minister</role>\n            </figure>\n            <figure>\n                <name>Benjamin Netanyahu</name>\n                <role>Israeli Prime Minister</role>\n            </figure>\n        </key_figures>\n        <summary>\n            Current tensions between Israel and Syria are characterized as minor, according to Itamar Rabinovich, who suggests that Syria may prefer negotiation over conflict.
