The focus will be on transforming each row into a string exactly matching the desired format of \"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\" while preserving all special characters, syntax, and spacing.\n\n## Step 3: Revise the prompt\n\nHere's a revised prompt that directly addresses these issues:\n\n\"Transform each row of {input_data} into a string in the exact format 'Name: {name}, Age: {age}', where '{name}' and '{age}' correspond to the values for name and age from the input data. Preserve all special characters, syntax, and spacing exactly as they appear in the input. Process each row independently without merging or inferring across rows, and output only the transformed strings in the specified format.\"\n\n## Step 4: Ensure clarity and directness\n\nThe revised prompt is clear about what's expected (transforming rows into a specific string format while preserving all details) and guides the model to focus on accuracy and format fidelity.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\"Transform each row of {input_data} into a string in the exact format 'Name: {name}, Age: {age}', where '{name}' and '{age}' correspond to the values for name and age from the input data. Preserve all special characters, syntax, and spacing exactly as they appear in the input.
