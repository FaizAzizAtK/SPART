    "optimised_prompt": "## Step 1: Analysis of the original prompt\nThe original prompt \"Do nothing\" is too vague and does not provide any clear instructions for the model to process the input data. This lack of direction will likely result in inaccurate or incomplete output.\n\n## Step 2: Identification of specific issues\nThe main issue with the original prompt is that it doesn't specify what the model should do with the input data, which contains personal information and ages of individuals. The desired output requires a specific format for each row, indicating both name and age.\n\n## Step 3: Revising the prompt to address these issues\nTo resolve the identified issues, we need to create a clear and direct prompt that guides the model to extract the name and age from each input data point and format it according to the desired output. This can be achieved by specifying the relevant information to focus on and the required output structure.\n\n## Step 4: Creating an optimised version of the prompt\nHere's a revised prompt:\n\n\"Extract and format the personal details from each row in {input_data} into the exact structure and format of 'Desired Outputs.' For each input, isolate the name and age, then combine them as 'Name: [name], Age: [age]'.\"\n\n## Step 5: Ensuring output fidelity\nThis revised prompt ensures that the model focuses on extracting specific information (names and ages), processes it in a clear and structured manner, and outputs it in the exact format of the desired results.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\"Extract and format the personal details from each row in {input_data} into the exact structure and format of 'Desired Outputs.' For each input, isolate the name and age, then combine them as 'Name: [name], Age: [age].'\"",
