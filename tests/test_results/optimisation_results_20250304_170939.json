    "original_prompt": "Do nothing.",
    "optimized_prompt": "## Step 1: Analysis of the original prompt\nThe original prompt simply states \"Do nothing.\" However, this does not provide any guidance on how to process the input data or what output format to use. This ambiguity will likely result in incorrect or incomplete outputs.\n\n## Step 2: Identification of specific issues\nThe main issue with the original prompt is its lack of specificity and clarity. It does not mention the input data or desired output, nor does it provide any instructions on how to transform the input into the desired format.\n\n## Step 3: Revision of the prompt to address these issues\nTo create a more effective prompt, we need to specify that the model should process each row of the input data and transform it into the exact structure and format of the desired output. We also need to ensure that the model preserves all special characters, syntax, and spacing.\n\n## Step 4: Revising the prompt\nHere is a revised version of the prompt:\n\"Process each row of `{input_data}` independently, preserving all special characters, syntax, and spacing. Output the result in the exact format of '{desired_output}'.\"\nNote that this prompt assumes that `desired_output` refers to the desired output format for a single input row.\n\n## Step 5: Optimization\nSince we have already addressed the main issues with the original prompt, no further optimization is needed. However, to make it more concise and clear, we can rephrase it as:\n\n\"Process each {input_data} row separately, keeping all formatting intact. Output in '{desired_output}' format.\"\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\"Process each input_data row separately, keeping all formatting intact. Output in 'Name: {name}, Age: {age}' format.\"",
