        "To find out how many pages James writes in a year, we need to first determine how many letters he writes each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.\n\n1. James writes 3 pages for each letter.\n2. He writes letters to 2 different friends, which means he writes:\n   \\( 2 \\text{ friends} \\times 3 \\text{ pages} = 6 \\text{ pages per week} \\)\n   This can be calculated as:\n   \\( 2 \\times 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 \\)\n\n3. James writes letters twice a week. Therefore, the total number of pages he writes in a week is:\n   \\( 6 \\text{ pages per letter} \\times 2 \\text{ letters} = 12 \\text{ pages per week} \\)\n   This can be calculated as:\n   \\( 6 \\times 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 \\)\n\n4. There are 52 weeks in a year. To find out how many pages he writes in a year, we multiply the number of pages he writes per week by the number of weeks in a year:\n   \\( 12 \\text{ pages per week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks} = 624 \\text{ pages per year} \\)\n   This can be calculated as:\n   \\( 12 \\times 52 = <<12*52=624>>624 \\)\n\nTherefore, James writes a total of **624 pages in a year**.",

Since she works 10 hours each day, she has:\n   - Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours\n   - Overtime hours = 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours\n\n2. **Total Days Worked**: Tina works for 5 days.\n\n3. **Regular Pay Calculation**:\n   - Regular pay per day = Regular hours x Hourly wage\n   - Regular pay per day = 8 hours x $18.00 = $144.00\n\n4. **Overtime Pay Calculation**: \n   - Overtime wage = Hourly wage + 1/2 of hourly wage\n   - Overtime wage = $18.00 + ($18.00 / 2) = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00\n   - Overtime pay for the 2 extra hours = Overtime hours x Overtime wage\n   - Overtime pay for the 2 extra hours = 2 hours x $27.00 = $54.00\n\n5. **Total Daily Pay**:\n   - Total daily pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay\n   - Total daily pay = $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00\n\n6. **Total Pay for 5 Days**:\n   - Total pay for 5 days = Total daily pay x Number of days worked\n   - Total pay for 5 days = $198.00 x 5 = $990.00\n\nThus, the total amount of money Tina makes for working 10 hours every day for 5 days is $990.00. \n\nIn conclusion, Tina makes a total of $990.00 for her work over the week.",
        "To determine how many people were on the ship that the deep-sea monster ate in the first hundred years, we first need to understand the pattern of how many people were consumed by the monster over the three hundred years.\n\nThe problem states that over three hundred years, the monster has consumed a total of 847 people. It also mentions that each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. This means that the number of people on the ships can be represented as follows:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of people on the first ship (the ship in the first hundred years).\n- Then, the number of people on the second ship (the ship in the second hundred years) is \\( 2x \\).\n- The number of people on the third ship (the ship in the third hundred years) is \\( 4x \\).\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of people consumed by the monster over the three hundred years:\n\n\\[\nx + 2x + 4x = 847\n\\]\n\nCombining the terms gives us:\n\n\\[\n7x = 847\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{847}{7} = <<847/7=121>>121\n\\]\n\nThus, there were 121 people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years. \n\nIn summary, the answer is: The ship the monster ate in the first hundred years had 121 people on board.",
        "To determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we will first calculate the total amount of money he saved up and then figure out how much he spent on the shoes.\n\n1. **Calculate Tobias's total savings from his allowance:**\n   - He gets $5 each month for 3 months, so:\n   \\[\n   5 \\, \\text{(dollars/month)} \\times 3 \\, \\text{(months)} = 15 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the money he earned from mowing lawns:**\n   - He mows 4 lawns, and charges $15 per lawn, so:\n   \\[\n   15 \\, \\text{(dollars/lawn)} \\times 4 \\, \\text{(lawns)} = 60 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate his total money before buying the shoes:**\n   - Add the money from his allowance to the money earned from mowing lawns:\n   \\[\n   15 \\, \\text{(allowance)} + 60 \\, \\text{(mowing)} = 75 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total money before buying shoes:**\n   - After buying the shoes for $95, he has $15 left. Therefore, we can calculate how much he spent on the shoes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total money before shoes} - \\text{Money left after shoes} = \\text{Cost of shoes}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   75 \\, \\text{(total money)} - 15 \\, \\text{(money left)} = 60 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n   Since the cost of shoes is $95, we can see that he didn't cover the whole cost with just his savings and earnings from mowing.\n\n5. **Determine how much money he needed to make up the difference:**\n   - The amount he needed to cover the cost of the shoes is:\n   \\[\n   95 \\, \\text{(cost of shoes)} - 75 \\, \\text{(total money)} = 20 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate how many driveways he had to shovel to make up the $20:**\n   - He charges $7 to shovel a driveway, so we need to find out how many driveways he shoveled:\n   \\[\n   20 \\, \\text{(needed)} / 7 \\, \\text{(dollars/driveway)} \\approx 2.857\n   \\]\n   Since he can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, we round down to 2 driveways.\n\nTherefore, Tobias shoveled 2 driveways to help earn the money he needed.",
        "To find out how many trees Randy has in total on his farm, we need to calculate the number of coconut trees he has based on the information provided about the mango trees.\n\n1.

            "James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends. This means he writes a total of:\n\n3 pages x 2 friends = <<3*2=6>>6 pages per week.\n\nSince he writes letters twice a week, the total number of pages he writes each week is:\n\n6 pages x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pages per week.\n\nNow, to find out how many pages he writes in a year, we need to calculate the number of weeks in a year, which is 52. Therefore, the total pages he writes in a year is:\n\n12 pages x 52 weeks = <<12*52=624>>624 pages.\n\nThus, James writes a total of 624 pages in a year. \n#### 624",
            "To determine how many flowers Mark has in his garden, we will break the problem down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of purple flowers**: \n   Mark has 10 yellow flowers. The number of purple flowers is 80% more than the yellow flowers. \n   We calculate 80% of 10:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 0.8 = <<10*0.8=8>>8\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total number of purple flowers is:\n   \\[\n   10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of yellow and purple flowers**: \n   Now, we add the number of yellow flowers to the number of purple flowers:\n   \\[\n   10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of green flowers**: \n   There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined. First, we find 25% of 28:\n   \\[\n   28 \\times 0.25 = <<28*0.25=7>>7\n   \\]\n   So, there are 7 green flowers.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden**: \n   Finally, we add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers together:\n   \\[\n   10 + 18 + 7 = <<10+18+7=35>>35\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of flowers that Mark has in his garden is 35. \n\n#### 35",
            "Albert bought 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. \n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of slices from the large pizzas:\n- Each large pizza has 16 slices, so for 2 large pizzas:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 16 = <<2*16=32>>32 \\text{ slices}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of slices from the small pizzas:\n- Each small pizza has 8 slices, so for 2 small pizzas:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 \\text{ slices}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we combine the slices from both types of pizzas to find the total number of slices Albert can eat:\n\\[\n32 + 16 = <<32+16=48>>48 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\n\nThus, if Albert eats all the pizza he bought, he will consume a total of 48 slices that day. \n\n#### 48",
            "To find the final weight of the box of goodies that Ken created, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Initially, Ken poured in jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. So we start with:\n   - Initial weight = 2 pounds.\n\n2. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Therefore, the weight after adding brownies is:\n   - New weight = 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 pounds.\n\n3. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. Thus, the weight becomes:\n   - Updated weight = 6 + 2 = <<6+2=8>>8 pounds.\n\n4. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. Therefore, the final weight of the box is:\n   - Final weight = 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 pounds.\n\nPutting it all together, the final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds. \n\n#### 16",
            "To determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we first need to calculate how much she spent in total on the other items.\n\n1. **Calculate the total spent on the clothing items:**\n   - Button-up shirt: $30\n   - Suit pants: $46\n   - Suit coat: $38\n   - Socks: $11\n   - Belt: $18\n\n   We sum these amounts:\n   \\[\n   30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = <<30+46+38+11+18=143>>143\n   \\]\n\n   So, Alexis spent a total of $143 on the shirt, pants, coat, socks, and belt.\n\n2. **Determine the total budget and the remaining amount:**\n   - Total budget: $200\n   - Amount left after purchases: $16\n\n   To find out how much she spent in total, we subtract the remaining amount from her budget:\n   \\[\n   200 - 16 = <<200-16=184>>184\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the shoes:**\n   To find the cost of the shoes, we subtract the total spent on the other items from the total amount spent:\n   \\[\n   184 - 143 = <<184-143=41>>41\n   \\]\n\nThus, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.\n\n#### 41",
            "Tina makes $18.00 an hour. Since she works 10 hours each day for 5 days, we first need to determine how many hours she works beyond the standard 8 hours to calculate her overtime pay.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of overtime hours:**\n   - She works 10 hours per day, which means:\n     - Overtime hours per day = 10 - 8 = 2 hours.\n\n2. **Calculate total hours worked in a week:**\n   - Total hours in a week = 10 hours/day \u00d7 5 days = 50 hours.\n\n3. **Calculate regular hours and overtime hours for the week:**\n   - Regular hours = 8 hours/day \u00d7 5 days = 40 hours.\n   - Overtime hours = Total hours - Regular hours = 50 - 40 = 10 hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the overtime pay rate:**\n   - Overtime pay rate = Hourly wage + (1/2 \u00d7 Hourly wage) = 18 + (1/2 \u00d7 18) = 18 + 9 = $27.00 per hour.\n\n5. **Calculate total earnings:**\n   - Regular pay = Regular hours \u00d7 Hourly wage = 40 \u00d7 18 = $720.\n   - Overtime pay = Overtime hours \u00d7 Overtime pay rate = 10 \u00d7 27 = $270.\n   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = 720 + 270 = $990.\n\nThus, Tina makes a total of $990 for her work during the week.\n\n#### 990",
            "To determine how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, we need to analyze the information given.\n\n1. The problem states that the monster has consumed a total of 847 people over three hundred years.\n2. It also mentions that every new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\n\nLet's break down the consumption over the three hundred years:\n\n- The first hundred years, the monster eats a certain number of people (let's call this number \\( X \\)).\n- In the second hundred years, the ship has twice as many people, which means the monster eats \\( 2X \\).\n- In the third hundred years, the ship has twice as many as the second hundred years, so the monster eats \\( 4X \\).\n\nNow we can set up an equation based on the total number of people consumed:\n\n\\[\nX + 2X + 4X = 847\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n7X = 847\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( X \\), we divide both sides by 7:\n\n\\[\nX = 847 / 7 = <<847/7=121>>121\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years was 121.\n\n#### 121",
            "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Tobias has saved and how many driveways he shoveled.\n\n1. **Calculate Tobias's savings from his allowance:**\n   Tobias receives $5 as an allowance each month for 3 months. \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 3 = <<5*3=15>>15\n   \\]\n   So, he saved $15 from his allowance.\n\n2. **Calculate earnings from mowing lawns:**\n   Tobias mows 4 lawns and charges $15 for each lawn.\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 4 = <<15*4=60>>60\n   \\]\n   Thus, he earned $60 from mowing lawns.\n\n3. **Total savings before buying shoes:**\n   Now, we add the money he saved from his allowance and the money he earned from mowing lawns.\n   \\[\n   15 + 60 = <<15+60=75>>75\n   \\]\n   So, Tobias has a total of $75 before buying the shoes.\n\n4. **Calculate the amount spent on shoes:**\n   The cost of the shoes is $95. After buying the shoes, Tobias has $15 left in change.\n   Let \\( x \\) be the total amount he had before buying the shoes. \n   Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   x - 95 = 15\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives us:\n   \\[\n   x = 95 + 15 = <<95+15=110>>110\n   \\]\n   So, Tobias had $110 before he bought the shoes.\n\n5. **Calculate how much he earned from shoveling driveways:**\n   We already know that he earned $75 from his allowance and mowing lawns. Thus, the money he earned from shoveling driveways can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   110 - 75 = <<110-75=35>>35\n   \\]\n   This means he earned $35 from shoveling driveways.\n\n6. **Calculate how many driveways he shoveled:**\n   He charges $7 for each driveway. To find out how many driveways he shoveled, we divide the total amount he earned from shoveling driveways by the amount he charges per driveway.\n   \\[\n   35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.\n\nIn conclusion, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways. \n#### 5",
            "Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm. \n\nTo find out how many coconut trees he has, we first calculate half of the number of mango trees:  \nHalf of mango trees = 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30. \n\nSince Randy has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees, we subtract 5 from this amount:  \nCoconut trees = 30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of trees on Randy's farm by adding the number of mango trees and coconut trees together:  \nTotal trees = 60 + 25 = <<60+25=85>>85.\n\nTherefore, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm.  \n#### 85",
            "Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. Therefore, the cost per pound of cheddar cheese is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{2} = <<10/2=5>>5 \\text{ dollars per pound.}\n\\]\n\nNext, he buys a pound of cream cheese that costs half the price of the cheddar cheese:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2} = <<5/2=2.5>>2.5 \\text{ dollars.}\n\\]\n\nThen, he purchases a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 \\text{ dollars.}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount Jasper spends on all the ingredients:\n\n\\[\n10 + 2.5 + 20 = <<10+2.5+20=32.5>>32.5 \\text{ dollars.}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jasper spends a total of $32.5 on the ingredients. \n#### 32.5",
            "Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 1 minute, we can calculate:\n\n8 pages / 20 minutes = <<8/20=0.4>>0.4 pages per minute.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes it will take her to read 120 pages. We can set up the equation:\n\n120 pages / 0.4 pages per minute = <<120/0.4=300>>300 minutes.\n\nNow, to convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:\n\n300 minutes / 60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages. \n\n#### 5",
            "To find out how much profit James makes in 20 weeks from his media empire, we need to break down the problem into several steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost to produce one DVD:**\n   The cost to make each DVD is $6.\n\n2. **Calculate the selling price of each DVD:**\n   James sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost. \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2.5 = <<6*2.5=15>>15\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the selling price per DVD is $15.\n\n3. **Calculate the profit for each DVD:**\n   The profit per DVD is the selling price minus the cost to make it.\n   \\[\n   15 - 6 = <<15-6=9>>9\n   \\]\n   Hence, the profit per DVD is $9.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of DVDs sold in one day:**\n   James sells 500 DVDs a day.\n\n5. **Calculate the profit made in one day:**\n   The total profit for one day is the profit per DVD multiplied by the number of DVDs sold.\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 500 = <<9*500=4500>>4500\n   \\]\n   Therefore, James makes $4500 profit in one day.\n\n6. **Calculate the profit made in one week:**\n   James works 5 days a week, so the weekly profit is:\n   \\[\n   4500 \\times 5 = <<4500*5=22500>>22500\n   \\]\n   This means he makes $22,500 profit in one week.\n\n7. **Calculate the profit made in 20 weeks:**\n   Finally, to find the total profit over 20 weeks, we multiply the weekly profit by 20.\n   \\[\n   22500 \\times 20 = <<22500*20=450000>>450000\n   \\]\n   Thus, James makes a total profit of $450,000 in 20 weeks.\n\nIn conclusion, James makes a profit of $450,000 from his media empire in 20 weeks. \n#### 450000",
            "To solve this problem, we first need to determine Mike's share of the profit based on the ratio of their shares and then calculate how much he has left after buying a shirt.\n\n1. The profit is shared in the ratio of Mike to Johnson as 2:5. This means for every 2 parts Mike receives, Johnson receives 5 parts. \n2. The total parts of profit are 2 + 5 = 7 parts.\n\n3. Johnson's share is given as $2500. Since Johnson's share corresponds to 5 parts, we can find the value of one part:\n   \\[\n   2500 / 5 = <<2500/5=500>>500 \\text{ (value of one part)}\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, we can find Mike's share, which corresponds to 2 parts:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 500 = <<2*500=1000>>1000\n   \\]\n\n5. Mike initially has $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, we need to determine how much he has left:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800\n   \\]\n\nThus, after spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have $800 remaining.\n\n#### 800",
