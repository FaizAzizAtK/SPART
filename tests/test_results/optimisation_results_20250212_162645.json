This lack of specificity can lead to inconsistent results.\n\n**Issue 1: Ambiguity**\nThe prompt is too vague, allowing the model to make assumptions about what \"doing nothing\" means in this context. It doesn't specify how to extract information from the input data or format it into the desired output structure.\n\n**Issue 2: Misalignment with Desired Outputs**\nThe desired outputs are well-defined and follow a specific format (\"Name: [name], Age: [age]\"). However, the prompt does not provide any instructions on how to achieve this format.\n\n**Improvement Focus**\n\nTo create an effective prompt, we need to:\n\n1. Specify that the input data should be processed to extract name and age information.\n2. Guide the model to output the extracted information in the desired format (\"Name: [name], Age: [age]\").\n\n**Optimized Prompt**\n\n```\nExtract names and ages from each row of {input_data} and output them in the exact format of \"Desired Outputs\".\nPreserve all special characters, syntax, and spacing.\nProcess each row independently to produce one output per input.\n```",
