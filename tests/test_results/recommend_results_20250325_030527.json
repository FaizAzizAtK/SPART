        "To provide a response that meets the requirements of enclosing the system prompt in `<prompt><system>...</system></prompt>` and incorporating the input data `Hey there, I\u2019m James and I\u2019m 28`, let's design a basic interaction script. For this example, we'll create a simple system that responds with a greeting based on the user's name.\n\n### The System Script\n\n```python\nclass GreetingSystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.input_data = \"\"\n\n    def process_input(self):\n        # Process input data here, in this case, just print it\n        print(\"<system>Tags: Input received -\", self.input_data)\n        \n    def respond(self):\n        name = \"James\"  # For demonstration, we're assuming the input name is James\n        \n        if name:\n            response = f\"Hello {name}, nice to meet you!\"\n            return response\n        else:\n            return \"Could not identify your name.\"\n\n# Initialize and run the system\nsystem = GreetingSystem()\nuser_input = \"Hey there, I\u2019m James and I\u2019m 28\"\nsystem.input_data = user_input\n\nprint(\"<prompt><system>\", end=\"\")\nsystem.process_input()\nresponse = system.respond()\nprint(response)\nprint(\"</system></prompt>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `GreetingSystem` class encapsulates the logic of our simple conversation system.\n- The `process_input` method takes in the input from a user, prints it as part of the system prompt, and stores it for further processing.\n- The `respond` method generates a response based on the name mentioned in the input data. If no name is found, it returns a default message.\n- We initialize the system with an example input string `\"Hey there, I\u2019m James and I\u2019m 28\"`, process this input as part of our system's output, generate a greeting response based on \"James,\" and print the system prompt along with its response.\n\n### Output:\n\n```\n<prompt><system>Tags: Input received - Hey there, I\u2019m James and I\u2019m 28\nHello James, nice to meet you!\n</system></prompt>\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how one might design a simple conversation flow that incorporates user input data into a system prompt. The actual implementation could vary significantly depending on the complexity of your project, including using natural language processing for more sophisticated responses or integrating with external APIs for additional functionality.",
        "It seems like you're referring to the structure of a system or program's interaction with a user, possibly for testing or debugging purposes. This structure often involves a prompt where the system requests input from the user, which is then processed by the system in some way.\n\nTo clarify your request:\n\n1. **Initial System Prompt**: The starting point where the system asks for an action or input. This can be anything that initiates a dialogue or process between the system and the user. For educational purposes, let's say this prompt is simply \"Enter Your Name: \"\n\n2. **User Input (Data)**: This is where the user provides information to the system. Based on your example, the user might input something like \"My name is Ava, and I am 23.\"\n\n3. **Processing by System**: After receiving the user's input, the system would process it. This could involve various actions depending on the system's purpose, such as validating the input, storing it in a database, or using it to generate output.\n\n4. **Final System Prompt Enclosed in Tags**: The prompt that indicates the final part of this interaction with the system, enclosed in tags for easy identification. However, without more context about what these tags signify (e.g., XML tags for data storage), their exact purpose and content depend on your specific use case.\n\n5. **Data Output or Response**: This is where the system responds to the user's input. It could be a simple \"Thank you,\" an output based on the processed input, or even initiating further interaction.\n\nGiven these points, if we're discussing how to present such interactions in a structured format, using tags like `<prompt>...</prompt>` for initial and final prompts, and potentially `<data>...</data>` for user input, it seems there's interest in clarifying this process within the context of structured data or system interactions. \n\nHowever, without specific details about what these tags should contain or how they're being used (e.g., XML or HTML for web applications, programming languages like Python or Java), the exact syntax and use case cannot be precisely defined.\n\nIf you have a project or scenario where such structured interactions are crucial, consider specifying the technology stack and requirements more clearly to get tailored guidance.",

We might use Python as our programming language due to its simplicity.\n\n#### The Program Could Look Something Like This:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_info():\n    # Where the user input happens\n    name = input('What is your name? ')\n    age = input('How old are you? ')\n\n    return {'name': name, 'age': age}\n\nuser_data = get_user_info()\nprint(\"You said:\")\nfor key, value in user_data.items():\n    print(f\"{key.capitalize()}: {value}\")\n\n# This part would be more appropriate with system tags as per your initial description\ndef process_input(data):\n    # Here's where you'd handle any '<system>' specific logic\n    print(\"<system> Tags: The final system prompt should be enclosed in <prompt><system>...</system>\")\n    return data\n\nprocessed_data = process_input(user_data)\nprint(f\"Processed Data: {processed_data}\")\n```\n\nThis example shows a basic program that asks for the user's name and age, then prints out what was entered. The `process_input` function is where you'd implement any specific logic related to your '<system>' tags.\n\nHowever, without more context on what these tags represent or how they're used in your scenario, it's difficult to provide a precise implementation.

This could represent any kind of information you're collecting from users. For example:\n\n```python\n# Example usage in Python\ninput_data = \"They call me Lucas, and I am 38 years old\"\n```\n\nOr if this is a more structured piece of data (for instance, coming from a form):\n\n```python\n# Example with structured data\ninput_name = \"Lucas\"\ninput_age = 38\n\ninput_data = f\"They call me {input_name}, and I am {input_age} years old.\"\n```\n\n### Usage in Context\n\nHere's how you might use these elements within a context, for example, if you're building a simple interactive program or script:\n\n```python\n# Example in Python\ndef greet_user():\n    input_data = \"They call me Lucas, and I am 38 years old\"\n    \n    # Process the input data here\n    print(\"Input Data:\", input_data)\n    \n    # System prompt\n    system_prompt = \"<prompt><system>Thanks for sharing!</system></prompt>\"\n    print(system_prompt)\n\ngreet_user()\n```\n\nThis example shows how you can incorporate user input and display a system prompt after processing that input.
