BEIJING 1996-08-22 China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing. Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters: The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities. State media quoted China's top negotiator with Taipei, Tang Shubei, as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks. Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ... that is to end the state of hostility, Thursday's overseas edition of the People's Daily quoted Tang as saying. The foreign ministry's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. China, which has long opposed all Taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition, was infuriated by a visit to Ukraine this week by Taiwanese Vice President Lien.\n</prompt>\n```",

Colleen Siegel JERUSALEM 1996-08-22 Israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup. Itamar Rabinovich, who as Israel 's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria, told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight. It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate. The Syrians are confused, they are definitely tense, but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup, he said. Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador. He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician. Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message, via Washington, saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions. But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere. Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile. It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes. The message that we sent to ( Syrian President Hafez al- ) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview. Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government's willingness to make Golan concessions. Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February. The voices coming out of Damascus are bad, not good. The media... are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying... this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners, Levy said. We expect from Syria, if its face is to peace, that it will answer Israel 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal, he said. We do not want a war, God forbid. No one benefits from wars. Israel 's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a calming signal to Israel. It gave no source for the report. Netanyahu and Levy.\n</prompt>\n```",
