        "To find out how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, we start by noting that the monster has consumed a total of 847 people over 300 years. Since the monster rises every hundred years, we can break this down into three periods of 100 years each.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of people on the ship during the first hundred years as \\( x \\). According to the problem, each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the last one. Therefore, in the second hundred years, the ship would have \\( 2x \\) people, and in the third hundred years, it would have \\( 4x \\) people.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation for the total number of people consumed over 300 years:\n\n\\[\nx + 2x + 4x = 847\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms gives us:\n\n\\[\n7x = 847\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{847}{7} = 121\n\\]\n\nThis means that during the first hundred years, the monster ate a ship that had 121 people on it. \n\nThus, the final answer is: The number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years was <<121=121>>121.",
        "To find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we first need to calculate how much money he has saved before buying the shoes.\n\n1. Tobias receives a $5 allowance each month for three months. Therefore, the total amount from his allowance is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate how much money he earns from mowing lawns. He mows 4 lawns and charges $15 per lawn. Therefore, the total amount earned from mowing is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 4 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we can find out how much money Tobias has saved in total before buying the shoes. This includes his allowance and the money earned from mowing:\n   \\[\n   15 + 60 = 75 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Tobias buys shoes that cost $95. After buying the shoes, he has $15 left. Therefore, the amount he spent on the shoes can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   75 - \\text{amount spent} = 15\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\text{amount spent} = 75 - 15 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. Since he spends $60 on shoes and knows he charges $7 to shovel driveways, we can find out how many driveways he shoveled. Let \\( x \\) represent the number of driveways he shoveled. The total money earned from shoveling driveways can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   7x = 60\n   \\]\n\n6. To find \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 7:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{60}{7} \\approx 8.57\n   \\]\n   This means he can't have shoveled a fractional driveway, so we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 8.\n\nFinally, the number of driveways that Tobias shoveled is approximately 8. Thus, the answer is <<number of driveways=8>>8.",
        "To find out how many trees Randy has in total on his farm, we first need to determine the number of coconut trees he has. He has 60 mango trees, and the problem states that he has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. \n\nFirst, we calculate half of the number of mango trees:  \nHalf of 60 is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30. \n\nNext, we subtract 5 from this amount to find the number of coconut trees:  \n30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 coconut trees.\n\nNow we can find the total number of trees by adding the number of mango trees and coconut trees together:  \n60 (mango trees) + 25 (coconut trees) = <<60+25=85>>85.\n\nTherefore, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm. \n\nThe final answer is <<total=85>>85.",
        "To find out how much Jasper spends on the ingredients for his dinner party, we need to calculate the cost of each item he buys and then add them together.\n\n1. Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. Therefore, the cost of the cheddar cheese is $10.\n2. The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the cheddar cheese is $10, the cream cheese costs $10 / 2 = $5.\n3. The pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Therefore, the cold cuts cost 2 * $10 = $20.\n\nNow, we add the costs of all the ingredients together:\nTotal cost = Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of cream cheese + Cost of cold cuts\nTotal cost = $10 + $5 + $20 = $35.\n\nThus, Jasper spends a total of $35 on the ingredients. \n\nThe final answer is <<10 + 5 + 20 = 35>>35.",
        "To find out how long it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we first need to determine her reading rate. She reads 8 pages in 20 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in one minute, we divide the number of pages by the time in minutes: \n\n8 pages / 20 minutes = 0.4 pages per minute.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take her to read 120 pages at this rate. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages by her reading rate:\n\n120 pages / 0.4 pages per minute = 300 minutes.\n\nFinally, we convert the time from minutes to hours since the question asks for hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60:\n\n300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages. \n\nIn conclusion, the total time is calculated as follows: 120 / (8/20) = 300 minutes, which is equal to 5 hours. \n\nThus, the final answer is <<300/60=5>>5 hours.",
        "To determine James's profit from his media empire, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the selling price of each DVD:** The cost to make each DVD is $6, and he sells it for 2.5 times that amount. Therefore, the selling price per DVD is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2.5 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, James sells each DVD for $15.\n\n2. **Calculate the revenue from selling DVDs:** James sells 500 DVDs each day for 5 days a week. Thus, the total number of DVDs sold in a week is:\n   \\[\n   500 \\times 5 = 2500\n   \\]\n   Consequently, over 20 weeks, the total number of DVDs sold is:\n   \\[\n   2500 \\times 20 = 50000\n   \\]\n   The total revenue from selling these DVDs is:\n   \\[\n   50000 \\times 15 = 750000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of producing the DVDs:** The cost to produce each DVD is $6, so the total production cost for 50000 DVDs is:\n   \\[\n   50000 \\times 6 = 300000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the profit:** Profit is determined by subtracting the total production costs from the total revenue:\n   \\[\n   750000 - 300000 = 450000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, James makes a total profit of $450,000 over 20 weeks. This can be summarized as <<profit=450000>>450000.",
        "To find out how much Mike will have after spending some of his share on a shirt, we first need to determine the total profit based on Johnson's share. Johnson received $2500, which corresponds to the 5 parts of their profit ratio (2:5). \n\nSince Johnson's share represents 5 parts of the ratio, we can find the value of one part by dividing his share by 5: \n$$\n\\text{Value of one part} = \\frac{2500}{5} = 500.\n$$ \n\nNow, Mike's share corresponds to 2 parts of the ratio. Therefore, we can calculate Mike's total share as:\n$$\n\\text{Mike's share} = 2 \\times 500 = 1000.\n$$ \n\nNext, Mike spends $200 on a shirt, so we need to subtract this amount from his share:\n$$\n\\text{Amount Mike has left} = 1000 - 200 = 800.\n$$ \n\nThus, after spending $200 on the shirt, Mike will have $800 remaining. \n\nThe final answer is <<1000-200=800>>800.",
        "To find the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck after Carl and John take some away, we first need to calculate how many hard hats are removed.\n\nInitially, there are:\n- 26 pink hard hats\n- 15 green hard hats\n- 24 yellow hard hats\n\nThe total number of hard hats initially in the truck is:\n26 + 15 + 24 = <<26+15+24=65>>65 hard hats.\n\nNext, we account for the hard hats that Carl and John take away:\n- Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats.\n- John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. Therefore, he also takes away 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of hard hats removed:\nTotal removed = 4 (Carl's pink) + 6 (John's pink) + 12 (John's green) = 22 hard hats.\n\nFinally, we find the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck:\nRemaining hard hats = Initial total - Total removed = 65 - 22 = <<65-22=43>>43 hard hats.\n\nThus, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is 43. Therefore, the final answer is <<calculation=43>>43.",
        "To find out how many hours Roque takes to get to and from work a week using both walking and biking, we first calculate the time he spends walking and then the time he spends biking.\n\nRoque walks to work and back three times a week. Each walk takes him 2 hours one way, which means the round trip takes 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours. Therefore, for three days of walking to and from work, he spends:\n\n3 days x 4 hours/day = 12 hours walking.\n\nNext, Roque rides his bike to work and back two times a week. Each bike ride takes him 1 hour one way, which means the round trip takes 1 hour x 2 = 2 hours. Therefore, for two days of biking to and from work, he spends:\n\n2 days x 2 hours/day = 4 hours biking.\n\nNow, we add the total hours spent walking and biking:\n\n12 hours (walking) + 4 hours (biking) = 16 hours total.\n\nThus, Roque takes a total of 16 hours to get to and from work each week. \n\nThe final result is <<total_hours=16>>16.",
        "To determine how much time Tim spends biking in a week, we first need to calculate the total distance he bikes during the week. \n\n1. Tim bikes to work and back home each day. Since his work is 20 miles away, the round trip for one day is:\n   \\( 20 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ miles} \\).\n   \n2. For 5 workdays, the total distance he bikes is:\n   \\( 40 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 200 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n3. Additionally, he goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. Therefore, the total distance Tim bikes in a week is:\n   \\( 200 \\text{ miles (work)} + 200 \\text{ miles (weekend)} = 400 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n4. Now, to find out how much time he spends biking, we use the formula:\n   \\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\].\n   Plugging in the total distance and his biking speed:\n   \\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{400 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ mph}} = 16 \\text{ hours} \\].\n\nIn conclusion, Tim spends a total of 16 hours biking each week. Thus, the final answer is <<400/25=16>>16 hours.",
        "To find out how many stamps Bella bought in total, we need to calculate the number of truck stamps and rose stamps based on the information provided.\n\n1. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.\n2. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:\n   \\( 11 + 9 = 20 \\) truck stamps.\n3. Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Thus, the number of rose stamps is:\n   \\( 20 - 13 = 7 \\) rose stamps.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of stamps Bella bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:\n\\[ 11 + 20 + 7 = 38 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bella bought a total of 38 stamps. \n\nThe final answer is <<38=result>>38.",
        "To find out how many beetles are eaten each day, we start by calculating how many snakes are eaten by the jaguars. Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, and there are 6 jaguars. Therefore, the total number of snakes eaten by the jaguars is:\n\n5 snakes/jaguar * 6 jaguars = 30 snakes.\n\nNext, we find out how many birds are eaten by these snakes. Each snake eats 3 birds per day, so the total number of birds eaten by the 30 snakes is:\n\n3 birds/snake * 30 snakes = 90 birds.\n\nFinally, we determine how many beetles are eaten by those birds. Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, so the total number of beetles eaten by the 90 birds is:\n\n12 beetles/bird * 90 birds = 1080 beetles.\n\nThus, the total number of beetles eaten each day is <<12*90=1080>>1080.",
        "To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of letters in Bobbie's last name. Let's denote the number of letters in Bobbie's last name as \\( b \\). According to the problem, Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's, so we can represent the number of letters in Samantha's last name as \\( b - 3 \\).\n\nNext, if Bobbie takes two letters off her last name, she would have \\( b - 2 \\) letters left. The problem states that this remaining length would be twice the length of Jamie's last name. Jamie's last name is \"Grey,\" which consists of 4 letters. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nb - 2 = 2 \\times 4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side gives us:\n\n\\[\nb - 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( b \\), we add 2 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nb = 8 + 2 = 10\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Bobbie's last name has 10 letters, we can find the number of letters in Samantha's last name:\n\n\\[\nb - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, Samantha's last name has 7 letters. \n\nIn conclusion, the total number of letters in Samantha's last name is <<7>>7.",
        "To find out how much each top cost, we first need to calculate the total amount Ann spent on the shorts and shoes. \n\nAnn bought 5 pairs of shorts at $7 each, which costs:\n5 * 7 = $35 for the shorts.\n\nShe also bought 2 pairs of shoes at $10 each, which costs:\n2 * 10 = $20 for the shoes.\n\nNow, we can find the total amount spent on shorts and shoes by adding these two amounts together:\n$35 (shorts) + $20 (shoes) = $55 total spent on shorts and shoes.\n\nNext, we subtract this total from the overall amount Ann spent ($75) to find out how much she spent on the tops:\n$75 (total) - $55 (shorts and shoes) = $20 spent on tops.\n\nSince Ann bought 4 tops, we divide the total amount spent on tops by the number of tops to find the cost of each top:\n$20 / 4 = $5 per top.\n\nTherefore, the cost of each top is $5. \n\nThe final answer is <<20/4=5>>5.",
        "To determine how much credit Mary will need to pay before her next shopping trip, we first calculate how much she has already paid towards her $100 credit limit. Mary paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. \n\nWe add these two amounts together: \n\n15 + 23 = 38.\n\nThis means Mary has paid a total of $38 towards her credit. \n\nNext, we subtract the total amount she has paid from her credit limit to find out how much she still owes:\n\n100 - 38 = 62.\n\nTherefore, Mary will need to pay $62 before her next shopping trip.\n\nIn conclusion, the amount of credit Mary still needs to pay is <<100 - 38 = 62>>62.",
        "To find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we first need to calculate how many balls he hit from the two groups of tennis balls he practiced with.\n\n1. For the first 100 balls, Ralph hits 2/5 of them. We calculate this as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balls hit from first group} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\n   \\]\n\n2. For the next 75 balls, Ralph hits 1/3 of them. We calculate this as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balls hit from second group} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 75 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we add the number of balls Ralph hit from both groups:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total balls hit} = 40 + 25 = 65\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, to find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we subtract the total balls hit from the initial total of tennis balls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balls not hit} = 175 - 65 = 110\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of tennis balls Ralph did not hit is 110, represented as <<175 - 65 = 110>>110.",
        "To find out how much salt Jack will get when all the water evaporates, we need to determine the total amount of salt in the 2 liters of seawater. Since the water is 20% salt, we can calculate the amount of salt by taking 20% of 2 liters.\n\nFirst, we convert 2 liters to milliliters because 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. Therefore, 2 liters is equal to:\n\n2 liters * 1000 ml/liter = 2000 ml.\n\nNext, we calculate 20% of 2000 ml:\n\n20% of 2000 ml = 0.20 * 2000 ml = 400 ml.\n\nThus, when all the water evaporates, Jack will get 400 ml of salt. The final answer is <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml.",
        "To determine how many valuable files Brennan has left after deleting the irrelevant ones, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of files Brennan deleted from the first batch.**\n   He downloaded 800 files and deleted 70% of them. To find out how many he deleted, we can calculate:\n   \\[\n   800 \\times 0.70 = 560\n   \\]\n   Therefore, he deleted 560 files. \n\n   The number of valuable files left from the first batch is:\n   \\[\n   800 - 560 = 240\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of files downloaded in the second round and how many were irrelevant.**\n   Brennan downloaded 400 more files. From these, he found that 3/5 were not helpful. To calculate how many files were irrelevant, we can perform the following calculation:\n   \\[\n   400 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 240\n   \\]\n   So, he deleted 240 files from the second batch.\n\n   The number of valuable files left from the second batch is:\n   \\[\n   400 - 240 = 160\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the valuable files from both batches together.**\n   Finally, we combine the valuable files from the first and second batches:\n   \\[\n   240 + 160 = 400\n   \\]\n\nThus, after deleting the unrelated files, Brennan is left with a total of 400 valuable files. \n\nThe final answer is <<400=400>>400 valuable files.",
        "To find out how many gnomes are in the fifth house, we first need to calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses. Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, so we perform the multiplication: 4 houses * 3 gnomes per house = 12 gnomes. \n\nNext, we know that the total number of gnomes on the street is 20. To find out how many gnomes are in the fifth house, we subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes: 20 total gnomes - 12 gnomes in the first four houses = 8 gnomes in the fifth house.\n\nThus, the fifth house has 8 gnomes. \n\nIn conclusion, there are 20 - (4 * 3) = <<20-(4*3)=8>>8 gnomes in the fifth house.",
        "To find Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote her previous monthly income as \\( x \\).\n\nInitially, she spent 40% of her income on rent and utilities, which can be expressed as:\n\\[\n0.40x\n\\]\nAfter her salary increase of $600, her new income becomes \\( x + 600 \\). Now, she spends 25% of her new income on rent and utilities, which can be expressed as:\n\\[\n0.25(x + 600)\n\\]\n\nSince these two amounts are equal (the amount spent on rent and utilities before and after the increase), we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n0.40x = 0.25(x + 600)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n1. Distribute the 0.25 on the right side:\n\\[\n0.40x = 0.25x + 150\n\\]\n\n2. Subtract \\( 0.25x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n0.40x - 0.25x = 150\n\\]\n\\[\n0.15x = 150\n\\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 0.15:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{150}{0.15} = 1000\n\\]\n\nThus, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000. Therefore, the final answer is <<calculation=1000>>1000.",
        "To find out how many pizza pieces are left uneaten, we first need to determine how many pieces each person eats based on the percentage of their pizza they consume.\n\n1. Each personal pan pizza is cut into 4 pieces.\n2. Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas, while Bill and Dale eat 50% of theirs.\n\nCalculating the pieces eaten by each person:\n- **Ann:** 75% of 4 pieces is calculated as 0.75 * 4 = 3 pieces. \n- **Cate:** Similarly, 75% of 4 pieces is also 0.75 * 4 = 3 pieces.\n- **Bill:** 50% of 4 pieces is calculated as 0.50 * 4 = 2 pieces.\n- **Dale:** 50% of 4 pieces is also 0.50 * 4 = 2 pieces.\n\nNow, we add up the total pieces eaten:\n- Total pieces eaten = 3 (Ann) + 3 (Cate) + 2 (Bill) + 2 (Dale) = 10 pieces.\n\nNow we calculate the total number of pizza pieces initially:\n- There are 4 pizzas (one for each person), and each pizza has 4 pieces, so total pieces = 4 * 4 = 16 pieces.\n\nFinally, we find the number of pieces left uneaten:\n- Pieces left uneaten = Total pieces - Total pieces eaten = 16 - 10 = 6 pieces.\n\nThus, the number of pizza pieces left uneaten is <<16-10=6>>6.",
        "To find out Noah's sales for this month, we first need to calculate his sales from last month. \n\nNoah sold 8 large paintings and each large painting is sold for $60. Therefore, the total sales from large paintings last month is calculated as:\n8 (large paintings) * $60 (per painting) = $480.\n\nNext, Noah sold 4 small paintings, with each small painting priced at $30. Thus, the total sales from small paintings last month is:\n4 (small paintings) * $30 (per painting) = $120.\n\nNow, we add the sales from both types of paintings to find his total sales for last month:\n$480 (from large paintings) + $120 (from small paintings) = $600.\n\nSince Noah sold twice as much this month, we multiply his total sales from last month by 2:\n$600 * 2 = $1200.\n\nTherefore, Noah's sales for this month is <<600*2=1200>>$1200.",
        "To find out how far the car traveled after the 3rd turn, we need to calculate the distance it traveled after the 1st and 2nd turns and then subtract that from the total distance traveled around the ring.\n\nFirst, let's add the distances traveled after the 1st and 2nd turns:\n- After the 1st turn, the car travels 5 meters.\n- After the 2nd turn, the car travels 8 meters.\n\nNow we sum these distances:\n5 meters + 8 meters = 13 meters.\n\nNext, we know the total distance traveled around the ring is 23 meters. To find the distance traveled after the 3rd turn, we subtract the distance already traveled from the total distance:\n23 meters - 13 meters = 10 meters.\n\nTherefore, the distance the car traveled after the 3rd turn is 10 meters. \n\nIn conclusion, the car had to travel a distance of <<23 - (5 + 8) = 10>>10 meters after the 3rd turn.",
        "To calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza, we start by identifying the quantities needed:\n\n1. Kimber needs 10 cups of water.\n2. She needs 16 cups of flour.\n3. The amount of salt required is 1/2 times the number of cups of flour. Since she needs 16 cups of flour, we calculate the salt: 1/2 * 16 = 8 teaspoons of salt.\n\nNow, we add these quantities together:\n\n10 cups of water + 16 cups of flour + 8 teaspoons of salt. \n\nTo combine these, we note that salt is measured in teaspoons, while water and flour are in cups. For the sake of total quantity, we can simply add them together as follows:\n\n10 + 16 + 8 = 34.\n\nThus, the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is 34.\n\nThe final answer is <<10 + 16 + 8 = 34>>34.",
        "To find out how much money Mr. Sam shared between his two sons, we first need to determine how much Tony received. Since Tony got twice as much as Ken, we can calculate Tony's share by multiplying Ken's amount by 2. \n\nKen received $1750, so:\nTony's amount = 2 * 1750 = $3500.\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of money shared by adding Ken's and Tony's amounts together:\nTotal shared amount = Ken's amount + Tony's amount = 1750 + 3500 = $5250.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money that was shared is <<1750 + 3500=5250>>$5250.",

        "To determine how much Mr. Benson paid in total for the concert tickets, we first calculate the total cost of the tickets without the discount. The cost of one ticket is $40, and Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets. Therefore, we calculate the total cost without the discount as follows:\n\n12 tickets * $40 per ticket = $<<12*40=480>>480.\n\nNext, we find out how many tickets exceed the limit for the discount. Since Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and the discount applies to tickets exceeding 10, we have:\n\n12 tickets - 10 tickets = 2 tickets that qualify for the discount.\n\nNow, we calculate the discount amount for these 2 tickets. The discount is 5% of the ticket price, which is $40. Therefore, the discount per ticket is:\n\n5% of $40 = 0.05 * $40 = $<<0.05*40=2>>2.\n\nSince there are 2 tickets eligible for the discount, the total discount amount is:\n\n2 tickets * $2 discount per ticket = $<<2*2=4>>4.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total discount from the original total cost to find out how much Mr. Benson paid in all:\n\n$480 - $4 = $<<480-4=476>>476.\n\nThus, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for the concert tickets. \n\nThe final answer is: <<calculation=476>>476.",

            "To find the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years, we first determine how many ships the monster has consumed over three hundred years. Since the monster appears every hundred years, it has eaten from three ships.\n\nWe know that the total number of people consumed over these three hundred years is 847. Let\u2019s denote the number of people on the ship in the first hundred years as \\( x \\). Since each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the last ship, the second ship would have \\( 2x \\) people, and the third ship would have \\( 4x \\) people.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation based on the total consumption:\n\\[\nx + 2x + 4x = 847\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n7x = 847\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{847}{7} = 121\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years was 121. \n\nThe answer can be summarized as follows:\nIn the first hundred years, the monster consumed a ship with 121 people on it, calculated as follows: \\( 7x = 847 \\) leading to \\( x = 121 \\). \n\nFinal result: <<x=121>>121.",
            "Tobias has been saving his allowance for 3 months at $5 per month, so he has saved 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15 from his allowance. \n\nIn addition to his allowance, he mows 4 lawns, earning 4 * 15 = $<<4*15=60>>60 from mowing. \n\nLet \\( d \\) represent the number of driveways he shovels. He earns $7 for each driveway, so he earns 7 * \\( d \\) = $<<7*d=7d>>7d from shoveling.\n\nThe total amount of money Tobias has before buying the shoes is the sum of his savings from the allowance, earnings from mowing, and earnings from shoveling: \n\\[ 15 + 60 + 7d. \\]\n\nHe buys shoes that cost $95, and after the purchase, he has $15 left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 15 + 60 + 7d - 95 = 15. \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ 15 + 60 + 7d - 95 = 15 \\]\n\\[ 75 + 7d - 95 = 15 \\]\n\\[ 7d - 20 = 15 \\]\n\\[ 7d = 35 \\]\n\\[ d = 5. \\]\n\nThus, Tobias shovels 5 driveways. \n\nThe final answer is that Tobias shovels <<5>>5 driveways.",
            "Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm. To find out how many coconut trees he has, we first calculate half of the number of mango trees, which is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30. Since he has 5 less than this amount, we subtract 5 from 30, giving us 30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 coconut trees. \n\nNow, to find the total number of trees on his farm, we add the number of mango trees and coconut trees together: 60 + 25 = <<60+25=85>>85 trees. \n\nThus, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm. \n\n#### 85",
            "Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, so the cost per pound of cheddar cheese is $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5. The pound of cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, which is 5 / 2 = $<<5/2=2.5>>2.5. The pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese, which is 10 * 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20. \n\nNow, to find the total amount spent on the ingredients, we calculate the sum of the costs: $10 (cheddar) + $2.5 (cream cheese) + $20 (cold cuts) = $<<10+2.5+20=32.5>>32.5.\n\nThus, Jasper spends a total of $32.50 on the ingredients. \n\n#### 32.5",
            "Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in one hour, we can calculate the number of 20-minute intervals in one hour, which is 60 minutes divided by 20 minutes, resulting in 60 / 20 = 3 intervals. Therefore, in one hour, she can read 8 pages multiplied by 3 intervals, giving us 8 * 3 = 24 pages.\n\nNext, to determine how many hours it will take her to read 120 pages, we divide the total pages by the number of pages she can read in one hour: 120 pages divided by 24 pages per hour equals 120 / 24 = 5 hours.\n\nThus, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages. \n\nThe final answer is <<120/24=5>>5 hours.",
            "To determine how much profit James makes in 20 weeks, we first need to calculate the total costs and total revenue from the movie sales.\n\n1. The cost to create one DVD is $6. If James sells 500 DVDs a day for 5 days a week, his weekly sales amount to:\n   \\[\n   500 \\text{ DVDs/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 2500 \\text{ DVDs/week}\n   \\]\n   The total cost for producing these DVDs each week is:\n   \\[\n   2500 \\text{ DVDs/week} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars/DVD} = 15000 \\text{ dollars/week}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we calculate the selling price of each DVD. James sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost of making it:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ dollars/DVD} \\times 2.5 = 15 \\text{ dollars/DVD}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, his weekly revenue from selling DVDs is:\n   \\[\n   2500 \\text{ DVDs/week} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/DVD} = 37500 \\text{ dollars/week}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we can find the profit he makes each week by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue:\n   \\[\n   37500 \\text{ dollars/week} - 15000 \\text{ dollars/week} = 22500 \\text{ dollars/week}\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, to find the total profit over 20 weeks, we multiply the weekly profit by 20:\n   \\[\n   22500 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 20 \\text{ weeks} = 450000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total profit James makes in 20 weeks is <<450000=result>>450000.",
            "To find out how much Mike will have after spending some of his share, we first need to determine the total profit based on Johnson's share. Since Johnson's share is $2500 and he receives 5 parts of the total profit, we can find the value of one part by dividing Johnson's share by his ratio part.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of parts in the ratio:\n2 (Mike's share) + 5 (Johnson's share) = 7 parts.\n\nNext, we find the value of one part by dividing Johnson's share by his ratio part:\n$2500 / 5 = $500 per part.\n\nNow, we can find Mike's share by multiplying the value of one part by Mike's ratio part:\n$500 * 2 = $1000.\n\nAfter determining Mike's share, we need to subtract the cost of the shirt he bought:\n$1000 - $200 = $800.\n\nThus, after spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have $800 left. \n\nIn summary, Mike will have <<1000-200=800>>800 dollars after his expenditure. \n\n#### 800",
            "In the truck, there are initially 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats. First, we find the total number of hard hats before any are taken away: \n\n26 + 15 + 24 = <<26+15+24=65>>65 hard hats.\n\nCarl takes away 4 pink hard hats, so we subtract that from the total:\n\n65 - 4 = <<65-4=61>>61 hard hats remaining after Carl's removal.\n\nNext, John takes away 6 pink hard hats, which means we need to subtract 6 from the remaining pink hard hats:\n\n26 - 4 - 6 = <<26-4-6=16>>16 pink hard hats left.\n\nJohn also takes away twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. Since he took 6 pink hard hats, he takes away 2 * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 green hard hats.\n\nWe subtract the 12 green hard hats from the original 15 green hard hats:\n\n15 - 12 = <<15-12=3>>3 green hard hats left.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- 16 pink hard hats remaining,\n- 3 green hard hats remaining,\n- 24 yellow hard hats (which remain unchanged).\n\nNow we calculate the total number of hard hats that remain in the truck:\n\n16 + 3 + 24 = <<16+3+24=43>>43 hard hats remaining in total.\n\nThus, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is <<43=43>>43.",
            "To find out how many hours Roque takes to get to and from work each week, we first calculate the total time he spends walking and biking.\n\nRoque walks to work for 2 hours and back for another 2 hours, which means he spends a total of 2 + 2 = 4 hours walking to and from work each time he walks. Since he does this three times a week, the total time spent walking is 4 * 3 = 12 hours.\n\nNext, Roque rides his bike to work for 1 hour and back for another 1 hour, which means he spends 1 + 1 = 2 hours biking to and from work each time he rides. Since he does this two times a week, the total time spent biking is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.\n\nFinally, to find the total hours spent in a week, we add the time spent walking and biking: 12 + 4 = 16 hours.\n\nThus, Roque takes a total of 16 hours to get to and from work each week with walking and biking. \n\nThe final answer is <<16=16>>16.",
            "Tim rides his bike to work, which is 20 miles away. Since he rides back and forth, the total distance he bikes for each workday is 20 miles to work plus 20 miles back, which equals 20 + 20 = <<20+20=40>>40 miles per day. Over 5 workdays, he bikes a total of 40 miles * 5 days = <<40*5=200>>200 miles for work.\n\nOn the weekend, he goes for a bike ride of 200 miles. Therefore, the total biking distance for the week is 200 miles (work) + 200 miles (weekend) = <<200+200=400>>400 miles.\n\nTo find out how much time he spends biking, we divide the total distance by his biking speed. He bikes at a speed of 25 mph, so the time spent biking in hours is 400 miles / 25 mph = <<400/25=16>>16 hours.\n\nThus, Tim spends a total of 16 hours biking in a week. \n\n#### 16",
            "Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. Since she bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps is 11 + 9 = <<11+9=20>>20. She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, meaning the number of rose stamps is 20 - 13 = <<20-13=7>>7. Therefore, the total number of stamps Bella bought is 11 + 20 + 7 = <<11+20+7=38>>38. \n\n#### 38",
            "To find out how many beetles are eaten each day by the animals in the forest, we first need to calculate how many snakes are eaten by the jaguars. \n\nEach jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, and there are 6 jaguars. Therefore, the total number of snakes eaten by the jaguars is calculated as follows:\n\n6 * 5 = 30 snakes.\n\nNext, we calculate how many birds are eaten by those snakes. Each snake eats 3 birds per day, so:\n\n30 * 3 = 90 birds.\n\nFinally, we determine how many beetles are eaten by those birds. Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, so:\n\n90 * 12 = 1080 beetles.\n\nThus, the total number of beetles eaten each day is <<90*12=1080>>1080. \n\n#### 1080",
            "To solve the problem, we need to first determine the number of letters in each person's last name based on the information provided.\n\n1. Let's denote the number of letters in Bobbie's last name as \\( B \\). According to the problem, Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name. This can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   S = B - 3\n   \\]\n   where \\( S \\) is the number of letters in Samantha's last name.\n\n2. The problem also states that if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s last name. Jamie's last name is \"Grey,\" which has 4 letters. Therefore, we can formulate the second equation as:\n   \\[\n   B - 2 = 2 \\times 4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   B - 2 = 8\n   \\]\n   Adding 2 to both sides results in:\n   \\[\n   B = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. Now that we have the number of letters in Bobbie's last name, we can substitute this value back into the equation for Samantha's last name:\n   \\[\n   S = B - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of letters in Samantha\u2019s last name is 7.\n\nIn summary, Samantha\u2019s last name has 7 letters in total. \n\nFinal answer: <<S=7>>7.",
            "To find out how much each top cost, we first need to calculate the total amount Ann spent on the shorts and shoes.\n\n1. Ann bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each, so the total cost for shorts is 5 x 7 = $<<5*7=35>>35.\n2. She also bought 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each, so the total cost for shoes is 2 x 10 = $<<2*10=20>>20.\n3. Now, we add the total costs of the shorts and shoes: 35 + 20 = $<<35+20=55>>55.\n\nNow, to find out how much Ann spent on the tops, we need to subtract the total spent on shorts and shoes from the total amount she had, which is $75:\n\n4. The amount spent on tops is 75 - 55 = $<<75-55=20>>20.\n\nFinally, since Ann bought 4 tops, we divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops to find the price of each top:\n\n5. The cost of each top is 20 / 4 = $<<20/4=5>>5.\n\nThus, each top costs $5. \n\n#### 5",

To find out how much credit she still needs to pay, we subtract the amount she has paid from the total credit limit: $100 - $38 = $<<100-38=62>>62. Therefore, Mary will need to pay $62 before her next shopping trip. \n\n#### 62",
            "Ralph starts with a total of 175 tennis balls. First, he hits 2/5 of the first 100 balls. To find out how many he hit, we calculate 2/5 of 100, which is 2 * (100/5) = 2 * 20 = 40. \n\nNext, Ralph hits 1/3 of the next 75 tennis balls. We calculate 1/3 of 75, which is 1 * (75/3) = 1 * 25 = 25.\n\nNow, we add the number of balls he hit: 40 (from the first 100) + 25 (from the next 75) = 65 balls hit in total.\n\nTo find out how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we subtract the number of balls he hit from the total number of balls: 175 - 65 = 110.\n\nThus, Ralph did not hit a total of 110 tennis balls. \n\nThe final answer is <<175 - 65 = 110>>110.",
            "To find out how many milliliters of salt Jack will get when all the seawater evaporates, we start by calculating the total amount of salt in the seawater he collected. \n\nFirst, we know that Jack has 2 liters of seawater. Since there are 1000 milliliters in a liter, we convert 2 liters to milliliters:\n2 liters = 2 * 1000 = 2000 milliliters.\n\nNext, we know that the seawater is 20% salt. To find out how much of that volume is salt, we calculate:\n20% of 2000 milliliters = 0.20 * 2000 = 400 milliliters of salt.\n\nTherefore, when all the water evaporates, Jack will have 400 milliliters of salt.\n\nThe final answer is <<0.20*2000=400>>400 ml of salt.",
            "Brennan initially downloaded 800 files and deleted 70% of them. To find out how many files he deleted, I calculate 70% of 800, which is \\( 800 \\times 0.7 = 560 \\) files. Thus, he was left with \\( 800 - 560 = 240 \\) valuable files after the first deletion.\n\nNext, he downloaded 400 more files but found that \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of these were irrelevant. To determine how many irrelevant files were in this batch, I calculate \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 400 = 240 \\) files. Therefore, the number of valuable files from this second download is \\( 400 - 240 = 160 \\) files.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of valuable files Brennan has after both rounds of downloads, I add the valuable files from both rounds: \\( 240 + 160 = 400 \\) valuable files.\n\nIn conclusion, Brennan was left with a total of <<400=400>>400 valuable files after deleting the irrelevant ones.",

After her salary increase of $600, her new monthly income becomes M + 600. Now, her rent and utilities only account for 25% of her new income, which can be expressed as 0.25(M + 600).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n0.40M = 0.25(M + 600).\n\nNow, let's solve the equation step by step.\n\nFirst, we'll distribute the 0.25 on the right side:\n\n0.40M = 0.25M + 150.\n\nNext, we'll isolate M by subtracting 0.25M from both sides:\n\n0.40M - 0.25M = 150.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0.15M = 150.\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 0.15 to find M:\n\nM = 150 / 0.15 = 1000.\n\nThus, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000.\n\nThe final answer is <<M=1000>>1000.",

Therefore, the number of pieces each person eats can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Bill eats 50% of his pizza:\n   - Bill's pizza pieces eaten: 50% of 4 = 0.5 * 4 = <<0.5*4=2>>2 pieces.\n\n2. Dale also eats 50% of his pizza:\n   - Dale's pizza pieces eaten: 50% of 4 = 0.5 * 4 = <<0.5*4=2>>2 pieces.\n\n3.

            "To find out how far the car traveled after the 3rd turn, we first need to add the distances traveled after the 1st and 2nd turns. The car traveled 5 meters after the 1st turn and 8 meters after the 2nd turn. Therefore, the total distance after the 1st and 2nd turns is:\n\n5 + 8 = <<5+8=13>>13 meters.\n\nNext, we know that the total distance traveled around the ring is 23 meters. To find the distance traveled after the 3rd turn, we subtract the distance already traveled (13 meters) from the total distance (23 meters):\n\n23 - 13 = <<23-13=10>>10 meters.\n\nThus, the distance the car traveled after the 3rd turn is 10 meters. \n\n#### 10",
