Since she worked 10 hours every day for 5 days, she worked a total of 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50 hours in the week.\n\nFor the first 8 hours each day, she earns her regular hourly wage. Therefore, for the first 8 hours of each day:\n8 x $18.00 = $<<8*18=144>>144 per day.\n\nSince she worked 10 hours each day, she worked an additional 2 hours of overtime:\n2 x ($18.00 + (1/2 x $18.00)) = 2 x ($18.00 + $9.00) = 2 x $27.00 = $<<2*27=54>>54 of overtime pay per day.\n\nNow, adding her regular pay and overtime pay for one day gives:\n$144 + $54 = $<<144+54=198>>198 per day.\n\nTo find out her total earnings for 5 days, we multiply her daily earnings by 5:\n$198 x 5 = $<<198*5=990>>990.\n\n#### 990\n</output>",
            "<output>\nThe deep-sea monster has consumed a total of 847 people over three hundred years. Since it rises once every hundred years, we can conclude that it has feasted three times (once in each century).\n\nTo find out how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, we denote the number of people on the first ship as \\( x \\). According to the problem, each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the last ship. Therefore, for the second hundred years, the ship had \\( 2x \\) people, and for the third hundred years, the ship had \\( 4x \\) people.\n\nNow we can set up the equation based on the total number of people consumed:\n\\[\nx + 2x + 4x = 847\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n7x = 847\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 7 to find \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{847}{7} = 121\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years was \\( 121 \\).\n\n#### 121\n</output>",

This means he needs $5 more to cover the cost of the shoes.\\nIf he has $15 in change after buying the shoes, that means he had $15 + 95 = $110 before the purchase.\\nThus, he earned a total of $110 - $15 = $<<110-15=95>>95 from mowing and shoveling.\\nSince he already earned $60 from mowing 4 lawns, the remaining amount he earned from shoveling is $95 - 60 = $<<95-60=35>>35.\\nEach driveway shoveling earns him $7, so the number of driveways he shoveled is $35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5.\\n#### 5</output>",

So, he took away 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 green hard hats.\\n\\nNow, we calculate the remaining green hard hats: 15 - 12 = <<15-12=3>>3 green hard hats left.\\n\\nThe yellow hard hats were not affected, so there are still 24 yellow hard hats.\\n\\nNow, we can find the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck:\\n22 (pink) + 3 (green) + 24 (yellow) = <<22+3+24=49>>49 hard hats remaining.\\n#### 49\n</output>",
