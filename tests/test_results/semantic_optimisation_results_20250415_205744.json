            "To find out how many people were on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years, we need to analyze the information given in the problem.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   The monster rises every hundred years. Over three hundred years, it has consumed a total of 847 people. This means it feasted three times \u2013 once in each hundred-year period. The problem states that each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\n\n2. **Defining Variables**: \n   Let's denote the number of people on the ship in the first hundred years as \\( x \\). \n   - In the second hundred years, the ship has twice as many people, so it has \\( 2x \\).\n   - In the third hundred years, the ship has twice as many as the second ship, resulting in \\( 4x \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation**: \n   The total number of people consumed by the monster over the three hundred years can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x + 2x + 4x = 847\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combining Like Terms**: \n   Combine the terms on the left side:\n   \\[\n   7x = 847\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\( x \\)**: \n   To find \\( x \\), divide both sides by 7:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{847}{7} = 121\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   Therefore, the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years is 121.\n\n#### 121",
            "To solve this word problem, we will first calculate how much money Tobias has saved up and then determine how many driveways he shoveled based on the information provided.\n\n1. **Calculate Tobias's total savings from his allowance**:\n   - Tobias gets $5 allowance per month and has been saving for 3 months.\n   - Total from allowance = $5 \u00d7 3 = $15.\n\n2. **Calculate the earnings from mowing lawns**:\n   - Tobias mows 4 lawns, charging $15 per lawn.\n   - Total earnings from mowing = $15 \u00d7 4 = $60.\n\n3. **Determine the total amount of money Tobias saved**:\n   - Total savings = Allowance savings + Earnings from mowing lawns.\n   - Total savings = $15 + $60 = $75.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of shoes**:\n   - The shoes cost $95.\n\n5. **Determine how much money Tobias has after buying the shoes**:\n   - After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change.\n   - Therefore, the amount he actually spent on the shoes = Total money saved - Change left.\n   - This means he spent = $75 - $15 = $60 on the shoes.\n\n6. **Calculate how much money he used to pay for the shoes**:\n   - Since the shoes cost $95, the amount he needed to cover after his earnings must equal the cost of the shoes minus the change left.\n   - Thus, the total amount he contributed from his earnings must be $95 (cost of shoes) - $15 (change) = $80.\n\n7. **Calculate how many driveways he shoveled**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of driveways he shoveled.\n   - Earnings from shoveling driveways = $7 \u00d7 \\( x \\).\n   - Total income from mowing and shoveling = Earnings from mowing + Earnings from shoveling.\n   - Therefore, the equation becomes: \n     \\[\n     60 + 7x = 80\n     \\]\n\n8. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Rearranging the equation: \n     \\[\n     7x = 80 - 60\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     7x = 20\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{20}{7} \\approx 2.857\n     \\]\n   - Since Tobias cannot shovel a fraction of a driveway, we round this down to the nearest whole number, which means he shoveled 2 driveways (as he would need to earn whole amounts).\n\nTherefore, the final number of driveways Tobias shoveled is 2.\n\n#### 2",
            "To find out how many trees Randy has in total on his farm, we need to calculate the number of coconut trees based on the information given about the mango trees.\n\n1. **Mango Trees**: Randy has 60 mango trees.\n   \n2. **Coconut Trees Calculation**: The problem states that Randy has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. First, we will find half of the mango trees:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Half of Mango Trees} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n   Next, we need to find 5 less than this amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Coconut Trees} = 30 - 5 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Trees Calculation**: Now, we will add the number of mango trees and coconut trees to find the total number of trees:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Trees} = \\text{Mango Trees} + \\text{Coconut Trees} = 60 + 25 = 85\n   \\]\n\nThus, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm.\n\n#### 85",
            "To find out how much Jasper spends on the ingredients for his dinner party, we need to calculate the cost of each item he purchased and then add them together.\n\n1. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese**:\n   Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. \n   - Cost of cheddar cheese = $10.\n\n2. **Cost of Cream Cheese**:\n   The cost of the cream cheese is half the price of the cheddar cheese. \n   - Since the cheddar cheese costs $10, the cream cheese costs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of cream cheese} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Cold Cuts**:\n   The cost of the cold cuts is twice the price of the cheddar cheese.\n   - Therefore, the cost of cold cuts is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of cold cuts} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost**:\n   Now, we add the costs of all the ingredients together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of cheddar cheese} + \\text{Cost of cream cheese} + \\text{Cost of cold cuts}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we found:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 10 + 5 + 20 = 35 \\text{ dollars}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jasper spends a total of $35 on the ingredients.\n\n#### 35",
