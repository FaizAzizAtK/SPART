            "Title: China says Taiwan spoils atmosphere for talks  \nAuthor: Reuters  \nDate: 1996-08-22  \nContent: BEIJING 1996-08-22 China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing. Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters: The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities. State media quoted China's top negotiator with Taipei, Tang Shubei, as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks. Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ... that is to end the state of hostility, Thursday's overseas edition of the People's Daily quoted Tang as saying. The foreign ministry's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. China, which has long opposed all Taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition, was infuriated by a visit to Ukraine this week by Taiwanese Vice President Lien.",

            "Title: German July car registrations up 14.2 pct yr / yr  \nAuthor: Not specified  \nDate: 1996-08-22  \nContent: German first-time registrations of motor vehicles jumped 14.2 percent in July this year from the year-earlier period, the Federal office for motor vehicles said on Thursday. The office said 356,725 new cars were registered in July 1996 -- 304,850 passenger cars and 15,613 trucks. The figures represent a 13.6 percent increase for passenger cars and a 2.2 percent decline for trucks from July 1995. Motor-bike registration rose 32.7 percent in the period. The growth was partly due to an increased number of Germans buying German cars abroad, while manufacturers said that domestic demand was weak, the federal office said. Almost all German car manufacturers posted gains in registration numbers in the period. Volkswagen AG won 77,719 registrations, slightly more than a quarter of the total. Opel AG together with General Motors came in second place with 49,269 registrations, 16.4 percent of the overall figure. Third was Ford with 35,563 registrations, or 11.7 percent. Only Seat and Porsche had fewer registrations in July 1996 compared to last year's July. Seat posted 3,420 registrations compared with 5,522 registrations in July a year earlier. Porsche's registrations fell to 554 from 643.",

            "Title: Israel plays down fears of war with Syria  \nAuthor: Colleen Siegel  \nDate: 1996-08-22  \nContent: Israel's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup. Itamar Rabinovich, who as Israel's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria, told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight. It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate. The Syrians are confused, they are definitely tense, but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup, he said. Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador. He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician. Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message, via Washington, saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions. But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere. Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile. It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes. The message that we sent to (Syrian President Hafez al-) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview. Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government's willingness to make Golan concessions. Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February. The voices coming out of Damascus are bad, not good. The media ... are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ... this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners, Levy said. We expect from Syria, if its face is to peace, that it will answer Israel's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal, he said. We do not want a war, God forbid. No one benefits from wars. Israel's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a calming signal to Israel. It gave no source for the report. Netanyahu and Levy's spokesmen said",
            "Title: Polish diplomat denies nurses stranded in Libya  \nAuthor: Reuters  \nDate: 1996-08-22  \nContent: A Polish diplomat on Thursday denied a Polish tabloid report this week that Libya was refusing exit visas to 100 Polish nurses trying to return home after working in the North African country. This is not true. Up to today, we have no knowledge of any nurse stranded or kept in Libya without her will, and we have not received any complaint, the Polish embassy's charge d'affaires in Tripoli, Tadeusz Awdankiewicz, told Reuters by telephone. Poland's labour ministry said this week it would send a team to Libya to investigate, but Awdankiewicz said the probe was prompted by some nurses complaining about their work conditions such as non-payment of their salaries. He said that there are an estimated 800 Polish nurses working in Libya.",
            "Title: Two Iranian opposition leaders meet in Baghdad  \nAuthor: Hassan Hafidh  \nDate: 1996-08-22  \nContent: An Iranian exile group based in Iraq vowed on Thursday to extend support to Iran 's Kurdish rebels after they were attacked by Iranian troops deep inside Iraq last month. A Mujahideen Khalq statement said its leader Massoud Rajavi met in Baghdad the Secretary-General of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) Hassan Rastegar on Wednesday and voiced his support to Iran 's rebel Kurds. Rajavi emphasised that the Iranian Resistance would continue to stand side by side with their Kurdish compatriots and the resistance movement in Iranian Kurdistan, it said. A spokesman for the group said the meeting signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions. Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad. Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) group. PUK and Iraq 's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions, have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War. Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a U.S.-sponsored ceasefire last year. Mujahideen Khalq said Iranian troops had also been shelling KDP positions in Qasri region in Suleimaniya province near the Iranian border over the last two days. It said about 100 Iraqi Kurds were killed or wounded in the attack. Both Iran and Turkey mount air and land strikes at targets in northern Iraq in pursuit of their own Kurdish rebels. A U.S.-led air force in southern Turkey protects Iraqi Kurds from possible attacks by Baghdad troops."
