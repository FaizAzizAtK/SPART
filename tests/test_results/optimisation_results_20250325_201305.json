    "optimized_prompt": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help improve this system prompt based on the given guidelines and examples. Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original prompt: \"Extract the names and ages from the inputes in the format 'Name: {{name}}, Age: {{age}}'\". The examples provided show that inputs are statements about a person's name and age, and desired outputs list each attribute separately. So, the task is to parse these sentences into structured data.\n\nThe original prompt isn't very clear or specific. It just says \"Extract\" without much detail on how to process the input. This might lead to ambiguity in what exactly needs to be extracted\u2014whether it's extracting individual names and ages from each statement or compiling a list of attributes across all inputs.\n\nIn the examples, each input is converted into two separate lines for Name and Age. The desired output format has this consistent structure with colons separating each attribute. However, the original prompt doesn't specify that the output should be in this exact format. This could lead to outputs not matching the required structure if it's too vague.\n\nThe instructions mention increasing semantic and syntactic similarity while ensuring strict formatting consistency. So, I need to make sure the new prompt is both semantically accurate (capturing what needs to be extracted) and syntactically precise (ensuring correct output format).\n\nOne issue with the original prompt is that it says \"inputes\" which is a typo for \"inputs\". Also, it's missing some specific instructions like extracting individual fields or formatting constraints. To address this, I should rephrase the prompt to include these details.\n\nI think adding explicit instructions about extracting name and age separately would make it clearer. Also, mentioning the exact desired format can help ensure strict adherence. Maybe something like: \"For each input sentence, extract the name and age into two separate lines with 'Name:' followed by the name and 'Age:' followed by the age.\"\n\nThis way, the model knows exactly what to do without any ambiguity. It also provides a clear example of how each part should look in the output.\n\nAdditionally, including an example might help clarify further. For instance: \"Given the input 'My name is John and I am 30', the output should be:\nName: John\nAge: 30\"\n\nThis makes it explicit what transformation is expected, improving both semantic clarity and syntactic consistency.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the refined prompt would clearly instruct the model to extract specific parts of each input into a structured format. This should help improve the scores by ensuring that the outputs match the desired structure more accurately.\n</think>\n\n<p><system>\nFor each input sentence, extract the name and age into two separate lines formatted as \"Name: [name], Age: [age].\" Example:\nGiven the input \"My name is John and I am 30,\" the output should be:\n\nName: John\nAge: 30\n</system></p>",

            "<think>\nAlright, let's break down how to improve this system prompt based on the given feedback.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Issue:** The original prompt lacked specific instructions, leading to ambiguity in what exactly should be extracted.\n\n2. **Clarify Instructions:** Add explicit commands to extract name and age separately for each input sentence.\n\n3. **Specify Output Format:** Ensure the output follows a consistent structure with clear labels (e.g., Name: [name], Age: [age]).\n\n4. **Include Examples:** Provide an example of desired output to enhance clarity and ensure accurate formatting.\n\n5. **Fix Typos:** Correct any typos like \"inputes\" to \"inputs.\"\n\n6. **Rephrase for Clarity:** Use clear language that directs the model precisely what tasks to perform.\n\n**Refined System Prompt:**\n\n```plaintext\n<p><system>\nFor each input sentence, extract and format as follows:\n- Name: [name]\n- Age: [age]\n\nExample:\nGiven the input \"My name is John and I am 30,\" the output should be:\n\nName: John\nAge: 30\n\n</system></p>\n```\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```plaintext\n<p><system>\nFor each input sentence, extract and format as follows:\n- Name: [name]\n- Age: [age]\n\nExample:\nGiven the input \"My name is Sarah and she is 24 years old,\" the output should be:\n\nName: Sarah\nAge: 24\n\n</system></p>\n```\n\nThis refined prompt now clearly instructs the model on how to process each input sentence, ensuring that the outputs are both semantically accurate and syntactically consistent.",
            "<think>\nAlright, let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original prompt: \"Extract the names and ages from the inputes in the format 'Name: {{name}}, Age: {{age}}'.\" The examples show that inputs are statements about a person's name and age, with desired outputs listing each attribute separately. So, I need to ensure the model extracts both pieces of information correctly.\n\nThe original prompt has issues like missing instructions on extraction and formatting. It also includes a typo (\"inputes\" instead of \"inputs\"). To improve clarity and correctness, I'll rephrase it to include specific instructions about extracting name and age into separate lines with the exact format required.\n\nI'll ensure each instruction is clear: extract both parts from each sentence and present them in the specified structure. Including an example will help clarify further what's expected for better semantic understanding and syntactic consistency.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure to correct any typos and provide a clear example so the model knows exactly how to format its response.\n</think>\n\n<p><system>\nFor each input sentence, extract the name and age into two separate lines formatted as \"Name: [name], Age: [age].\" Example:\nGiven the input \"Greetings, I'm Alice, aged 35,\" the output should be:\n\nName: Alice\nAge: 35\n</system></p>"
