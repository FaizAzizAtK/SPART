            "<think>\nOkay, so I need to extract the name and age from the input sentence. The user provided an example where \"My name is Faiz and I am 21\" becomes two lines: Name: Faiz and Age: 21. Another example was similar but with a slightly different phrasing.\n\nLooking at the input data given, it's \"Hey! I'm Sarah and I'm 24 years old.\" I notice that \"I'm Sarah\" is the name part, so the name should be Sarah. For age, after \"I'm Sarah,\" there's another phrase: \"I'm 24 years old.\" So the age is 24.\n\nI need to make sure each output line follows the exact format without extra spaces or punctuation. So I'll write Name: Sarah on one line and Age: 24 on the next, each on separate lines as shown in the examples.\n</think>\n\nName: Sarah  \nAge: 24",
            "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to extract the name and age from this input sentence: \"Greetings, I'm Alice, aged 35\". The user wants the output in a specific format where each value is labeled as Name: followed by their value and Age: followed by theirs. Each entry should be on separate lines without any extra spaces or punctuation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the sentence structure. It starts with \"Greetings,\" which doesn't contain any personal information. Then it says \"I'm Alice\" \u2013 so that's where the name is. The name here is clearly Alice. Next part is \"aged 35.\" That should be the age.\n\nWait, but sometimes names can have different structures. Like maybe a middle name or something else? But in this case, it's straightforward: one name and an age mentioned after it. So I don't think there are any other names to extract here.\n\nI also need to make sure that when formatting, each part is on its own line without extra spaces. So the Name should be followed by a colon and space before the value. Same with Age.\n\nLet me double-check: \"Greetings, I'm Alice, aged 35\" \u2013 name is Alice, age is 35. That seems correct. There's no other information that might confuse the extraction process here.\n\nSo putting it together, the output should be two lines:\nName: Alice\nAge: 35\n\nI think that's all there is to it for this particular input.\n</think>\n\nName: Alice  \nAge: 35",
            "<think>\nAlright, so the user wants me to extract names and ages from given sentences. Let's see what they provided.\n\nFirst, there's an example: \"My name is Faiz and I am 21\" which becomes Name: Faiz and Age: 21 on separate lines. Another example: \"Hello my name is John and I am of the age 29\" gives Name: John and Age: 29.\n\nNow, looking at the input data they provided: \"They call me Robert, and I am currently 42 years old.\"\n\nI need to extract two pieces of information here. The first part after \"call me\" is Robert, so that's the name. The age comes after \"am currently,\" which is 42.\n\nSo, formatting each as Name: value and Age: value on separate lines. \n\nWait, should I check if there are other instances where name or age might appear? In this sentence, it seems only once for name and once for age.\n\nI think that's all. So the output will be two lines as specified.\n</think>\n\nName: Robert  \nAge: 42",
            "<think>\nOkay, so I need to extract the name and age from a given sentence. The input here is \"My name is Emily and I am 19\". Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify where the name is located in the sentence. It says \"My name is Emily\", so clearly Emily is the name. But sometimes names can be at the beginning or middle of a sentence, so I need to make sure my extraction method captures that correctly.\n\nNext, looking for the age part. The sentence continues with \"I am 19\". So the age comes after \"am\" in \"I am\". Sometimes ages might be mentioned differently, like \"twenty-one\" or \"age thirty\", but in this case, it's straightforward as \"19\".\n\nNow, formatting is important here. I need to output each value without extra spaces or punctuation, just the key followed by a colon and then the value on separate lines.\n\nSo putting it together, Name: Emily should be on one line and Age: 19 on another. Let me double-check if there are any other numbers in the sentence that might interfere with this. In this case, \"My\" is before name but not part of the name itself. The rest seems clear.\n\nWait, sometimes names can have more than one word, like \"Mary Ann\". But here it's just Emily, so simple. Also, if there are multiple people in the sentence, how would that work? For example, \"I have two brothers: John is 25 and Michael is 30.\" In this case, should I extract both names and their ages?\n\nBut the user provided examples only show single name and age pairs, so maybe for now, it's safe to assume each input sentence contains one name and age. But if there are multiple, perhaps only the first occurrence would be extracted or all of them? The problem statement isn't clear on that.\n\nIn this specific case, since the input is a single sentence with one name and age pair, I can proceed confidently.\n</think>\n\nName: Emily\nAge: 19",
            "<think>\nOkay, so the user has given me a task where I need to extract names and ages from sentences. The examples they provided are straightforward, like \"My name is Faiz and I am 21\" which becomes two lines: Name: Faiz and Age: 21. Another example is similar but with John and 29.\n\nNow, the input given is \"My name is Alex and I am 30\". Hmm, first thing I notice is that the structure is consistent\u2014looking for \"name\" after \"is\" or \"my\", followed by \"and I am age\". So I can probably split on those keywords to extract the values.\n\nWait, but sometimes there might be variations like \"Hello my name is John...\" as in one of their examples. Oh, wait no, that example was a different structure but still had \"is\" after the name. Maybe it's safe to assume that the format remains similar here.\n\nI should make sure each output line follows exactly without extra spaces or punctuation. So for Name: value and Age: value on separate lines. Let me check if there are any edge cases, like if the age is at the end or has different wording, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nSo I'll extract \"Alex\" as the name and 30 as the age, then format them exactly as required.\n</think>\n\nName: Alex  \nAge: 30",
            "<think>\nOkay, so I need to extract the name and age from a given sentence. The input is \"Hello there, I\u2019m Sophia and I\u2019m 27 years old\". Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I should look for words that indicate a person's name. In this case, it says \"I'm Sophia\", so the name is Sophia. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the age. The sentence mentions \"I\u2019m 27 years old\". So the age would be 27. I need to make sure I extract just the numerical value without any extra words like \"years old\".\n\nWait, sometimes names can have different structures, but in this case, it's pretty clear. Also, there are two instances of \"I'm\" which might be common in spoken text or informal writing. But since the name is directly mentioned as \"Sophia\", I should take that.\n\nSo putting it together, Name: Sophia and Age: 27.\n</think>\n\nName: Sophia  \nAge: 27",
            "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to extract the name and age from this sentence: \"Hey! My name is Liam, and I\u2019m currently 22.\" Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, looking for the name. The user says \"My name is Liam,\" so that should be straightforward. The name is clearly stated there. But wait, sometimes people might mention their name in different ways, like \"I'm named\" or something else, but here it's pretty direct: \"My name is Liam.\" So I can confidently take \"Liam\" as the name.\n\nNext, the age part. After the name, they say \"I\u2019m currently 22.\" So the age should be 22. But just to make sure, sometimes people might include additional information like their birth year or other details, but in this case, it's clearly stating the current age as 22.\n\nSo putting it together, Name: Liam and Age: 22. Each on separate lines without any extra spaces or punctuation.\n</think>\n\nName: Liam  \nAge: 22",
            "<think>\nOkay, so I need to extract the name and age from a given sentence. The input is \"Greetings, I am Ethan and I\u2019m 25\". Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look for the part where it says \"I am\" or something similar to identify the name. In this case, after \"Greetings,\" there's \"I am Ethan\", so that must be the name part. So the name is Ethan.\n\nNext, the age comes right after that phrase. It says \"I\u2019m 25\". The word before the number should be the age. So that would be 25. I need to make sure there are no extra spaces or punctuation in the output.\n\nPutting it together, the formatted sentence should be:\n\nName: Ethan\nAge: 25\n\nWait, but wait a minute. In some sentences, the structure might be different. Like, maybe the name isn't right after \"I am\". But in this case, it is. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlso, checking for any extra spaces or punctuation around the values. The output should only have \"Name: value, Age: value\" without anything else.\n</think>\n\nName: Ethan\nAge: 25",
            "<think>\nOkay, so I've been given this task where I need to extract the name and age from a sentence. The example they provided was helpful: \"My name is Faiz and I am 21\" becomes two lines with Name: Faiz and Age: 21. Another example was similar but had extra words before the age, like \"Hello my name is John and I am of the age 29,\" which still worked out as Name: John and Age: 29.\n\nNow, looking at the input data they provided: \"Hi, I\u2019m Olivia and I am 26.\" My first thought is to break down this sentence into parts. The structure seems consistent\u2014there's a name mentioned after \"I'm\" or \"My,\" followed by an age.\n\nSo, in the example sentences, the name comes right after \"My name is\" or something similar. In this case, it's \"Hi, I\u2019m Olivia...\" which means the name is \"Olivia.\" So that part should be straightforward.\n\nNext, for the age. In the first example, after the name, they say \"I am 21,\" so the age comes right after \"I am.\" In the second example, it was a bit longer: \"...I am of the age 29.\" But regardless of how many words are between \"I am\" and the actual number, I think we just need to extract the numerical value.\n\nSo for \"Hi, I\u2019m Olivia and I am 26,\" after \"I am,\" there's \"26.\" So the name is Olivia, and the age is 26.\n\nPutting it all together, each entry should be on separate lines with exactly \"Name: value\" and \"Age: value,\" without any extra spaces or punctuation. That means no commas or periods unless they're part of the output formatting, but in this case, I don't think so.\n\nI also need to make sure that there are no mistakes in the format. For example, sometimes people might have multiple names or age mentions, but from the examples, it seems like each sentence has one name and one age. So as long as I extract those two values correctly, I should be fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is case sensitivity. In the examples, the output was in lowercase except for the name \"Faiz,\" which stayed capitalized. Wait, no, actually, the example had \"Name: Faiz\" with a capital F. So perhaps the output maintains the casing as it appears in the input. So Olivia would be as written.\n\nSo putting this all together, I think the correct formatting should be:\n\nName: Olivia\nAge: 26\n\nThat's two lines, each starting with either \"Name:\" or \"Age:\", followed by a colon and space, then the value without any extra punctuation.\n</think>\n\nName: Olivia  \nAge: 26",
            "<think>\nOkay, so I need to extract the name and age from a given sentence. Let me look at the input data: \"Hello! My name is William, and I am 32 years old.\"\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the sentence looking for the name part. It says \"My name is William,\" which clearly states that the name is William.\n\nNext, I need to find the age. The sentence mentions \"I am 32 years old.\" So, the age here is 32.\n\nNow, I should format this information as \"Name: value, Age: value\" with each on separate lines. That means Name comes first, then Age.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write:\n\nName: William\nAge: 32\n\nI think that's all there is to it. Let me double-check if there are any other names or ages in the sentence. It doesn't seem like there are more than one person mentioned, so this should be accurate.\n</think>\n\nName: William  \nAge: 32"
