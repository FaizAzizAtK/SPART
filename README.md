SPART (Streamlined Prompt Automation and Recommender Tool):
A Prompt Recommender System for Accurate Content Generation

This project is a Python package to provide prompt engineering tools such as
recommending a prompt and evaluating it. Prompt Engineering has been on the rise since
generative AI has taken the world by storm. However, creating prompts is not a
straightforward process as well as evaluating them, this currently is a very manual process.
Repetitive testing can be tedious and costly; thus, this package aims to provide functions
that help prompt crafting easier.
